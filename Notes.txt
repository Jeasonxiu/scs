[1]. Try stretch record by record.
    -- Both schemes (Use half thinner S data / Use all data, half-thin ESW)
	   show FRS bin-stack bumps goes away (20160629).

[2]. Possble bug: stretch by records no negative tstar on synthesis: ~047@50deg.
	-- C++ bug found: Vertical stretch doesn't start with index=0. (20160713)

[3]. Fix a05.HandPick. Make it faster.
	-- Data process is upgraded, plotting is still slow as hell.

[4]. Try Mask S on data.
	-- Program done.
	-- Need eyeball inspection on "All" plots.

5. Misfit outliar throw away. What's the scheme?

[6]. Possible bug: Standard deviation at bin 34,35 is crazy.
	-- The crazy std goes away when I do the SNR_D-FinalWeight ramp between 7~15 (rather than 2~10).

7. Add a plot: ScS Amp / S Amp Data vs Predicted (on SYN or on Rad Prediction).
	-- Plot this: X-axis is gcarc, Y-axis has Data and Prediction (different color).

[8]. < 75 bin stack. What's the difference on distance-mixed bins?
	-- Eyeball check is hard.

9. Pick Same number of record from "quiet" bin ,stack them to see if they are as messy as the "noisy" ones. Need to know how many data is required for a meaningful stack.

10. Distance - FRS amplitude issue.

11. I ordered the "All" plot by Misfit4_ScS, why in 1D_REFL synthesis this is not the same order as gcarc?
