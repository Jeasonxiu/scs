[1]. Try stretch record by record.
    -- Both schemes (Use half thinner S data / Use all data, half-thin ESW)
	   show FRS bin-stack bumps goes away (20160629).

2. Possble bug: stretch by records no negative tstar on synthesis: ~047@50deg.

[3]. Fix a05.HandPick. Make it faster.

4. Try Mask S on data.

5. Misfit outliar throw away. What is its scheme ?


6. Possible bug: Standard devication at bin 34,35 is crazy.

7. ScS Amp / S Amp Data vs Predicted (SYN and Rad).

8. < 75 bin stack.o

9. Pick Same number of number of record from quiet bin ,stack them to see if they are messy.

10. Distance - FRS amplitude issue.
